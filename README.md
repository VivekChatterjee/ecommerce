# 🚀 How to Contribute 

### Fork the project

Click the gray `Fork` button at the top right of this page. This creates your copy of the project and saves it as a new repository in your GitHub account. 

### Clone this project on your computer
- Go to your profile. You will find forked repo named Ecommerce. Go to the repo by clicking on it.

- Click on the green Code button, then either the HTTPS or SSH option, and, click the icon to copy the URL. Now you have a copy of the project. Thus, you can play around with it locally on your computer.

- Run the following commands into a terminal window (Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, Bash, ZSH). Do this to download the forked copy of this repository to your computer

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce.git
```

> Replace your-username with your GitHub username.

###  Create a new branch
Make a meaningful name for your new branch.

Some Best Practices while naming branches:
+ hotfix -	for quickly fixing critical issues, usually with a temporary solution
+ fix -	for fixing a bug
+ feature - for adding, removing, or modifying a feature
+ test - for experimenting with something that is not an issue

This word is followed by your task.

Suppose you want to add a favicon to the website so you can name the branch as feature/add-favicon.

Now Once you have decided on the name of your branch. 

Then create and switch to it using this command:

```
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

### Make Changes
- Make the necessary changes or customizations to the code as needed.

- After making your changes, you need to stage the changes for commit using the git add command. To stage all changes, use:

```
git add .
```

or 

```
git add <file-name>
```

### Commit the changes

- Commit your staged changes with a descriptive commit message that explains the purpose of your changes. Use the git commit command:
```
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"
```

### Push Your Changes

```
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```
or
```
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main
```

### Raise a Pull Request.

- On the GitHub website, navigate to your forked repo - on the top of the files section, you'll notice a new section containing a `Compare & Pull Request button!`

- Click on that button, this will load a new page, comparing the local branch in your forked repository against the main branch in the Ecommerce repository. Do not make any changes in the selected values of the branches (do so only if needed), and click the green Create Pull Request button. 

> Note: A pull request allows us to merge your changes with the original project repo.

- Your pull request will be reviewed and then eventually merged.

Hurray! You successfully made your first contribution! 🎉
